Repository for Module 12 Challenge

## Summary
For this project, we created data frames using documents stored in MongoDB databse.  The documents contained data from the UK Food Standards Agency, which evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom and awards them a food hygiene rating. First, we updated the database by adding a new restaurant, Penang Flavours.  Next, we searched for various criteria, including rating value, hygiene score, and location, and filtered the data accordingly.  Finally, we used the aggregate function to create a pipeline that returned results specifically in the proximity of our new restaurant.
